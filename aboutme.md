<span class="fa fa-book about-icon"></span>
&nbsp;I love reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.inchoate.me/books/">books</a>. Reading makes my mind wander and wonder. I'm an ardent fan of novels. I dive into the fictional world which simulates in my mind while reading the story. I guess I have a pretty good collection of the books I've read uptil now. You can check them out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/42550719">here</a>. Make sure to add some of them in your future reading list.

<span class="fa fa-music about-icon"></span>
&nbsp;I have a weird choice of music and hence a weird playlist. I occasionally listen to rap songs.I prefer music which is not too hard to be pop, and has a gentle a touch of rock.

<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
&nbsp;I have numerous hobbies other than reading. Sketching is one of them. You can check out my pen, pencil and digital sketches in my <a target='_blank' href="https://www.instagram.com/iamrdk21">Instagram</a> story highlights. I love solving puzzles and Rubik's Cube. My fastest time for Rubik's cube is 42 sec. I'm working on it and I might be able to bring it under 30 sec by the next month. I love riding my bike. And lastly, I've developed an interest in beatboxing which I think is pretty amazing.
