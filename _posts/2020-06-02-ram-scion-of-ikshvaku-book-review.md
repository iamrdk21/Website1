***Ram-Scion of Ikshvaku:*** *Scion of Ikshvaku is a fantasy book by Indian author Amish Tripathi, released on 22 June 2015. It is based on Ram, the legendary Indian king regarded as an incarnation of Vishnu.*

Amish has been one of my favourite writers. I read the **Shiva Trilogy** when I was in class 10. Since then, I've been a fan. Amish is known to play with mythological characters in his fictional world which is the primary reason why his books become an instant hit.

The **Ram Chandra Series** is his second work of fiction. I liked the approach he's taken to write this series. He has written three books till now: Ram- Scion of Ikshvaku, Sita- Warrior of Mithila and Raavan- Enemy of Aaryavarta. All these stories are from the perspective of the protagonist and they end at the same scene. His fourth book will be a convergence of all these books and the main story will proceed further.

The book says that ***"the only true duty of a human is to understand one's destiny"***. 

**Ayodhya** is weakened by the recent war which caused heavy casualties. The people of the Sapt Sindhu are slowly losing their wealth and moving towards destitution. They need a saviour. A saviour who will end all their misery and bring justice to them by defeating  the monster who is draining all of India's wealth. Who will it be? (**Hint:** ***RAM***)

The book begins with the kidnapping of Sita by Raavan and then goes back to the time when Ram was born. Ram has been depicted as a strict follower of laws. The book follows with the Gurukul teachings, fight with Asuras, travel to Mithila, Sita's swayamwar, fight with Raavan, returning to Ayodhya and then being banished from the kingdom for 14 years against the wishes of Emperor Dasharatha and continues till the kidnapping of Sita.

The story starts off with a slow pace, picks up pace in the middle and then slows down again towards the end. When compared with his previous work **"The Shiva Trilogy"**, this book has been a bit of a let down. Though, it is a good read, it did not match the expectations the audience had from Amish.

***Favourite quote from the book:*** *Parents are like a bow, and children like arrows. The more the bow bends and stretches, further the arrow flies.*

That said, I am still quite amazed at the author's skill of creating something new out of something that is eons old. It's quite magnificient how Amish has blended the stories of Lord Rudra, Lord Parshuram and their respective tribes: Vayuputras and Malayaputras.

The author has amazing storytelling skills that have been lauded by eminent Indian authors. If one was a first-time Amish reader, he/she would surely find this compelling!
