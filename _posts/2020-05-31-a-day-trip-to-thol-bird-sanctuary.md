***GitHub:*** *In very simple terms, GitHub is a website for hosting your source code. It is a really cool and almost any repository on GitHub can be converted into a website.*

Who doesn't want a free hosting platform for their website? If you want a free hosting platform that is secure and reliable, GitHub is the best option. The only requirement: you should have some basic coding knowledge, really basic.

If you have your website ready or are planning to build one, and you have no idea how to host it, you're at the right place. We are going to follow some very simple steps and get our website live under 5 minutes!

**Step 1:**

Visit GitHub.com and sign-up for a free account. Verify your email and your account will be created. If you already have an account, ignore this step.

**Step 2:**

Go to the "Your repositories" section.

**Step 3:**

Click on the "New" button for creating a new repository.

**Step 4:**

Now, this is a <strong>critical</strong> step. While naming the repository, follow this convention:

{: .box-warning}
**[*your GitHub username*].github.io**

The above convention tells GitHub to host the files in your repository automatically and display them when someone points their browser to:

https://[***username***].github.io

Check the README dialog box and click on the "Create Repository" button.

**Step 5:**

Now here you have 2 options: **Upload files** or **Create new file**.

*Step 5.1:*

If you already have your website created on your computer, upload all the files and "Commit changes".

*Step 5.2:*

Let's say you're just starting to create your website.

Let's say for example we'll create a page named "**index.html**" and "Commit changes".

**Step 6:**

We are done with the basic version of our website and it has been successfully deployed after "committing changes". For checking out our website on the internet, just go the browser and type:

**<italic>username</italic>.github.io**

and press enter.

And voila, our website is live and running!!

You can add CSS, Javascript and other HTML files to your repository and commit changes. Your wwebsite will be automatically updated.
