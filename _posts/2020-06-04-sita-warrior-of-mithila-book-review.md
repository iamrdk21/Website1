***Sita - Warrior of Mithila:*** *A fantasy book by Indian author Amish Tripathi which was released on 29 May 2017. It is the second book of the Ram Chandra Series. The Series is a retelling of the most famous epic of India, the Ramayana. Each book in the series focuses on one important character of the Ramayana.*

"**Sita - Warrior of Mithila**" covers the same timeline as the first book of the series: **Ram - Scion of Ikshvaku**. This book has a very unique approach to it. Sita, as we traditionally know, has never been depicted as a warrior in any of the mythological texts. Amish has done a wonderful job of moulding the story and fitting the character of Sita in it as a fierce and a brave woman. If thinking out of the box is an art, Amish is definitely the Picasso of it.

The book starts with the adoption of Sita, followed by her upbringing, Gurukul, acquaintance with Vishwamitra, swayamvar and proceeds to her banishment along with her husband Ram from the kingdom of Sapt Sindhu. People know the life of Ram as they have been watching or hearing it since their childhood. But, very little is known about Sita. This book takes us on a remarkable journey through the life of Sita.

***Favourite quote from the book:*** *Donâ€™t be afraid of the dark, my child. Light has a source. It can be snuffed out. But darkness has no source. It just exists. This darkness is a path to That, which has no source: God.*

I felt this book to be a better read than <a href="https://www.inchoate.me/2020-06-02-ram-scion-of-ikshvaku-book-review/" target="_blank">**Scion of Ikshvaku**</a>. The character of Sita is very intriguing and keeps the reader fascinated throughout the book. The book is well paced and keeps the reader hooked until the end. The secret bond that Guru Vashishtha and Guru Vishwamitra share has not been revealed yet. The stage for **Raavan - Enemy of Aaryavarta** has been gracefully set by the author by ending the book on an unprecedented cliffhanger.

It's an amazing read. Definitely worth your time!
