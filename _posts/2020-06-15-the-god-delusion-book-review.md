***The God Delusion:*** *The God Delusion is a 2006 book by English biologist Richard Dawkins, a professorial fellow at New College, Oxford, and former holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair for the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford.*

A leading scientist - and the world's most famous atheist - asserts the irrationality of belief in God, and the dreadful harm that religion has inflicted on society, from the **Crusades** to **9/11**.

Dawkins has examined **God** in all his forms, from the self-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament, to the kind (but still not so smart) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightment thinkers. He points out the major arguments for religion, and demonstrates the improbability of an **almighty**. He has shown how religion fuels war, instigates bigotry, and abuses children, reinforcing his points with historical, contemporary and compelling evidence.

**The God Delusion** makes an argument that belief in God is not just wrong, but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of ***Atheism*** to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever make possible.

In my opinion, this book might change a religious person's mind for sure if they bothered to pick it up. The book is based on scientific evidences, and falsification of common defenses of religion and attacks upon atheism. We live in a modern society which is based on the principles of science. Yet, crimes and horrors committed in the name of religion are very well known. In this book, Dawkins has unearthed a few instances of such horrors which were unheard of. He has managed to address almost every religious argument that I've ever heard, and that too, in a cogent and organized manner.

***Favourite quote from the book:*** *When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called Religion.*

Richard Dawkins has a deep understanding about a lot of things. When you are done reading this book, you'll be left with a lot of things to ponder upon. Most of the people of today's generation who claim to be religious have never read their own religious books. And this is.. I don't know what to say. I just don't understand why everybody (not atheists) is taking religion so seriously when nobody's actually bothered to be aware of anything?

This book is a **MUST READ** to raise your consciousness about such things!
