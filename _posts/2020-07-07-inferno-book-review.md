***Inferno:*** *Inferno is a 2013 mystery thriller novel by American author Dan Brown and the fourth book in his Robert Langdon series, following Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code and The Lost Symbol. The book was published on May 14, 2013, ten years after publication of The Da Vinci Code (2003), by Doubleday.*

Harvard professor of symbology Robert Langdon awakens in an Italian hospital, disoriented and with no recollection of the past thirty-six hours, including the origin of the macabre object hidden in his belongings. With a relentless female assassin trailing them through Florence, he and his resourceful doctor, Sienna Brooks, are forced to flee.

Embarking on a harrowing journey, they must unravel a series of codes, which are the work of a brilliant scientist whose obsession with the end of the world is matched only by his passion for one of the most influential masterpieces ever written, Dante Alighieri's The Inferno.

Dan Brown has raised the bar yet again, combining classical Italian art, history, and literature with cutting-edge science in this sumptuously entertaining thriller.

People are critical about Dan's writing. They find his writing *formulaic*. Well, I know many may disagree with me, but I find the pattern in his books to be completely enjoyable. In **Inferno**, ha has swayed away from his routine writing. The novel starts off with the protagonist, *Robert Langdon*, suffering from amnesia. When I started reading the book, I was a bit skeptical about the direction in which the storyline was moving. But as the book progressed, I realized that the amnesia plot was very clever.

Even though he refrained from his regular formula, all the elements which make his books immensely popular are still present. As always, he has combined action with mystery, history and science in an amazing way and created a thriller that you just cannot put down. 

Dan Brown's writing is cinematographic. The greatest thing about any of his books is the setting in which the entire action takes place. This time the action takes place in three breathtaking cities: Florence, Venice and Istanbul. He really captures the atmosphere of the place he's describing and makes you feel as if you are a part of the adventure. The ending of the book is also unusual. I cannot explain the entire ending without spoiling the book but yeah, the ending is quite interesting.

***Favourite quote from the book:*** *The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their silence at times of crisis.*

Dan Brown's novels may not be great literature but they are definitely fun to read. And this book gives you food for thought as well.
