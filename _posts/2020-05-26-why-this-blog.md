title: Why This Blog?
subtitle: and what's it gonna be about?
---

One thing that makes me stand out is the quality of "not being bored". Even when I'm alone, I always keep doing something or the other. Learning and trying new things captivates me. So just like any other new hobby I've tried and pursued, this is my stint at <strong>blogging</strong>.

When I thought of starting this blog, just like any other newbie my first take was to use Medium as a "medium" to practise my new hobby or just use simple wordpress ready-to-use templates and make up my site and publish blogs. But then it occured to me: <strong>why be a normie when you could be OG?</strong> I have learned enough computer science to make up my own website and I decided to use what I've learnt. Atleast, I'll be writing by myself for a platform that is owned and created by me!

So, that's how this expedition began.

This blog will not have an audience-targeted niche. I'll write about various topics, most which will revolve around technology, politics, travel (as I've travelled a fair amount), rubik's cube, biking and well thing's which spike an interest in me. The unique thing about this blog would be the length of the posts I publish. No post would cross the "5 min read" mark. Well, one thing's for sure: <strong>You'll not get bored reading the posts that are shared on this blog.</strong>
