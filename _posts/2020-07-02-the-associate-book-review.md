***The Associate:*** *The Associate is a legal thriller by John Grisham. His 21st novel, it was published by Doubleday and released in the United States on January 26, 2009.*

Kyle McAvoy grew up in his father's small-town law office in York, Pennsylvania. He excelled in college, was elected editor-in-chief of The Yale Law Journal, and his future has limitless potential.

But Kyle has a secret, a dark one, an episode from college that he has tried to forget. The secret, though, falls into the hands of the wrong people, and Kyle is forced to take a job he doesn't want--even though it's a job most law students can only dream about.

Three months after leaving Yale, Kyle becomes an associate at the largest law firm in the world, where, in addition to practicing law, he is expected to lie, steal, and take part in a scheme that could send him to prison, if not get him killed.

With an unforgettable cast of characters and villains from Baxter Tate, a drug-addled trust fund kid and possible rapist, to Dale, a pretty but seemingly quiet former math teacher who shares Kyle's "*cubicle*" at the law firm, to two of the most powerful and fiercely competitive defense contractors in the country and featuring all the twists and turns that have made John Grisham a popular storyteller in the world, The Associate is a good read.

***Favourite quote from the book:*** *Live your life the way you want. You'll figure it out.*

This was my first Grisham book. Having never read a legal thriller before, I have mixed feeling about this book. The book seems interesting at first, but I don't know, I somehow did not connect with the story. The pace was alright, but, not exactly what you expect from a thriller. The ending did not have that same satisfying feel of a really good connection of all the threads of the story. I was thinking towards the end, how is Grisham going to wrap this up as there were many loose ends and not much story left to connect them. And to my disappointment, I found that he just decided to leave some things hanging. I think that he could have done much more with this.
