***iOS 14:*** *iOS 14 is the fourteenth major release of the iOS mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. for their iPhone, iPod Touch, and HomePod lines. It was announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 22, 2020 as the successor to iOS 13.*

A little bit early than expected, **Apple** has just released the first public beta of **iOS 14**. iOS 14 comes with tons of features and almost completely changes the appearance of your home screen. There are widgets on the home screen, for example, you can see little windows that show photos, the weather, music controls and much more. And it automatically organizes all of your apps for you. Moreover, Siri has a new look and doesnâ€™t take over the entire mobile screen.

In this post, I'm gonna show you guys how to get the beta running on your devices for free. And this method can be used to install iOS 14 on any device that was previously able to run iOS 13 (that is, iPhone 6S or newer).

Make sure you have at least 5 GB of free storage space on your device. This process is going to be very straight-forward and very easy.

**Step 1:**

Open *Safari*.

**Step 2:**

Head over to *<a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/</a>*.

**Step 3:**

On the same page, you'll find a button saying "*Sign up*". Click on it to sign up to the Apple Beta Software program.

**Step 4:**

Sign up using your Apple ID. Either use your password, fingerprint, or your Face ID.

**Step 5:**

You'll be brought to a page with an "*Agreement*" that you need to agree to.

Go all the way down and accept the agreement to proceed with the installation process.

**Step 6:**

After accepting the agreement, you'll be brought to a "*Guide for Public Betas*" page.

Scroll down until you reach the "*Get Started*" section. A single link ("*enroll your iOS device*") is present in the entire section. Click on it.

**Step 7:**

As we are doing this for iPhones, make sure you have the *iOS* tab selected.

Before proceeding further, I'd like you to backup your data. In this installation, it is highly unlikely that you'll lose data but it is still a possibility. So it's better to have a backup. (*I did not backup my data before installation, but, the data is still intact*)

Alright. Moving further down on the webpage you'll stumble upon the "*Install Profile*" section.

Click on the "*Download Profile*" button.

There you go. Now you have your iOS 14 public beta profile installed.

**Step 8:**

Head over to *Software Update* in your *General* Settings.

Once you are done with the installation, you'll notice a new *Feedback* application installed on your device. The main purpose of this application is to report any bugs or issues you face with iOS 14 Public Beta.
