***The Alchemist:*** *Novel by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho that was first published in 1988. Originally written in Portuguese, it became a widely translated international bestseller..*

One thing I think the planet certainly lacks the most now is **positivity**. I'm glad that this novel is a bestseller as it infuses its readers with positivity.

The book says that ***"the only true duty of a human is to understand one's destiny"***. 

This book gives you *confidence*! I've never been to a desert, but the story is so strong that I've actually felt as if I've lived in the desert. Not only does the author offer a clear summary of the scene but he also vividly portrays the feelings and emotions. I always felt the same emotional surge through me. At the beginning, the plot is fast paced, but slows down towards the middle with abrupt turns leading towards the end to exciting sections. I honestly did not know how to respond to the book's conclusion. At first it seemed as though the conclusion had disappointed me, but then, after a few moments of thinking, I realized that the book managed to solve its aim to make the reader understand that having confidence in your destiny would eventually lead you to understanding it. Now I think twice before I curse my fate. There's always a bigger plan that we can't grasp.
