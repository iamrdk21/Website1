***Raavan - Enemy of Aaryavarta:*** *Raavan: Enemy of Aryavarta is a 2019 mythological fiction written by Amish Tripathi. The third book in the Ram Chandra series after Scion of Ikshvaku and Sita: Warrior of Mithila, it chronicles the life of Ravan until the time he kidnaps Sita. The book was released on 1 July 2019 and published by Westland.*

"**Raavan - Enemy of Aaryavarta**" covers the same timeline as the other two book of the series.

A land in chaos. People suffering, some quietly, some rebelliously. Some fighting for others, some for themselves.

**Raavan**. Not like the villain of the original epic *Ramayana*, but a human - a mastermind, flawed but a strong personality capable of extreme love as well as extreme cruelty. Son to one of the most illustrious sages of the time. Talented. But cursed by fate. A man who will love without recompense and kill without regret.

The book unfolds with the childhood of Raavan, his hobbies (dreadful ones), followed by the birth of his brother Kumbhakaran, their escape from their father's ashram, Raavan's rise as a trader to the chief of military of Lanka, his one-sided love story, the war, and ends up with the kidnapping of Sita.

***Favourite quote from the book:*** *There is a lion and a deer within each of us. Only if we nurture the lion will we make something of ourselves. If we indulge the deer, weâ€™ll be running and hiding all our lives.*

This book was a much better read than <a href="https://www.inchoate.me/2020-06-02-ram-scion-of-ikshvaku-book-review/" target="_blank">**Scion of Ikshvaku**</a> and <a href="https://www.inchoate.me/2020-06-04-sita-warrior-of-mithila-book-review/" target="_blank">**Sita - Warrior of Mithila**</a>. The best book in the entire series!

The way the story unfolds is amazing. Once you start reading this book, you are in no position to put it down. The character of Raavan has many ups and downs. You'll love him as well be disgusted by him. **Kumbhakaran** is a lovely character. The bond that the brothers share is something that even death would not violate. The other characters of the book have been very well connected with the storyline of the previous books.

At it's heart, this book is a love story. Raavan's wrath on Sapt Sindhu is a result of the pain inflicted upon him by the loss of someone very dear to him. There are parts in this book that are overwhelmingly grief-stricken, though the narrative is not nuanced and pretty straight forward. It is simple, profound and effective. No difficult words used. No heavy literature. This is what makes the book very enjoyable. 

Raavan's entire story is based on the choices he makes. At every step, he is presented with two options, and his choice determines his course of life and shapes the man he becomes - merciless, but, a mere pawn in the much ***bigger game***.
