***HACKER:*** *An individual capable of solving complex non-intuitive problems in a seemingly intuitive manner.*

Traditionally, people have been using blogging engines (Content Management Systems) like Wordpress, Tumblr, Blogger, Medium, Squarespace, Gator, etc. for writing articles. These blogging engines are complex and cumbersome to use. I tried Wordpress for a few days and realized that it was not "it". The primary purpose of starting my blog was to try my hand at writing. I wanted to write amazing posts, not style hundreds of template pages, moderate comments all day long and constantly lag behind the latest software release. I wanted the hosting of my website to be of my choice, not something these engines suggested. And to be honest, Wordpress blogs are quite slow, unsecure and heavy. What I wanted to have was a rather simplistic, clean and nimble blog which was easy and convenient to update.

This is where **Jekyll** came in.

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static generator written in Ruby by GitHub's co-founder Tom Preston-Werner. It uses markdown and generates static HTML documents out of it. Static websites can hosted on GitHub without any hassle.

Jekyll Blogs are *cool*:

- No database required
- Manage everything with Git
- Publish from Terminal
- No hosting headaches
- Fast
- Reliable
- No bumpy plugins
- Full Control
- Safe
- Most importantly, it's unique!

Jekyll does what you tell it to do, no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart you by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden you with needless complexity and configuration.

Simply put, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: **Content**.
