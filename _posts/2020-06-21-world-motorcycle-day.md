***World Motorcycle Day:*** *June 21 is celebrated globally as World Motorcycle Day, a day for celebrating motorcycles, motorcycling and everything related to motorcycles. June 21 is also the longest day of the year, called the Summer Solstice, and what better day to spend outdoors, riding your motorcycle?*

***Just a small appreciation post for one of my most treasured belongings.***

Not gonna blabber on about my bike. Everybody loves their bike. Owning a bike gives a sense of freedom. Freedom to go anywhere. Anytime. Bike riding is an exhilarating experience. You get a sharper sense of observation, hearing, processing and analyzing the situation around you. If you are a passionate bike rider, you don't just merely exist, you "*live*".

- You do not need a therapist if you own a motorcycle, any kind of motorcycle!

- If you want to be happy for a day, drink. If you want to be happy for a year, marry. If you want to be happy for a lifetime, ride a motorcycle.

- Sometimes you really need a crooked road, to get your head straight.

- The joy of riding a motorcycle is out of this world. The thrill of riding in the hills and mountains is an opiatic addiction.

- When life gets you down, remember its only one down and the rest is up.

- The only way to see the sunset, is to ride into it.
