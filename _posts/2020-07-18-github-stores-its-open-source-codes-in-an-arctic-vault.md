***GitHub:*** *GitHub, Inc. is a United States-based global company that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.*

In 2019, *GitHub* introduced the "*GitHub Archive Program*" along with the "*GitHub Arctic Code Vault*". The mission behind this was to preserve open source softwares for future generations by storing our code in an archive built to last a thousand years.

In an <a href="https://github.blog/2020-07-16-github-archive-program-the-journey-of-the-worlds-open-source-code-to-the-arctic/">article</a> celebrating the undertaking’s success, GitHub’s Director for Strategic Programs Julia Metcalf has revealed that the service’s code collection was deposited into the vault on July 8th, 2020 after delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The successors of our generation, a 1000 years later from now, will be able to access data from what was the world's largest open-sorce software in the beginning of the 21st century.

*Piql*, the archive partner of *GitHub*, wrote 21TB of repo data onto 186 reels of PiqlFilm which is basically a digital photosensitive film that can be read by a computer, or a human with a magnifying glass. The boxes of film reels, adorned with GitHub's logo, were then shipped to Longyearbyen. The GitHub team had full archive of all current public repositories safely tucked into a decommissioned coal mine in the the Norwegian town (*Longyearbyen*) on the archipelago of Svalbard. On February 2, GitHub took a snapshot of all active public repos on the website. *Snapshot* is nothing but a copy of a system captured at an instance. So, in simpler terms, GitHub is backing up all the data.

According to the official statement, the transported code was stashed not only inside the mine, but further inside a chamber "*deep inside hundreds of meters of permafrost*".

To appreciate the contribution of the developers who have contributed to the GitHub vault, GitHub has rolled out a special badge that's displayed in the highlights section of the developer's profile. On hovering over the badge, it shows the projects they've contributed to, which ultimately became a part of the Arctic Vault.

So, even if we may not live for a millenium (which ofc we won't), our code may definitely achieve that milestone!
