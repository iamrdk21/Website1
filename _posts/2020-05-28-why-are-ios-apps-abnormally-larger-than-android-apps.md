Fed with up with his Android smartphone, recently, my friend switched over to iOS and got himself an iPhone 8. While setting up his iPhone and installing various apps, he was astounded by the sheer size of iOS apps. The differences in the app sizes are overwhelming.

Let's take a table for comparison.

| App | iOS Size | Android Size |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| WhatsApp | 237 MB | 23 MB |
| Instagram | 112 MB | 29 MB |
| Twitter | 113 MB | 17 MB |
| Facebook | 231 MB | 52 MB |
| Gmail | 176 MB | 14 MB |
| LinkedIn | 167 MB | 25 MB |
| Chrome | 66.8 MB | 34 MB |

There are various reasons for the insane size of iOS Apps:

- *iOS:* Distributed as native code taht rund directly on the CPU. Apple includes different copies of the app's code for different CPU architectures. Simply put, the size listed on the App Store includes all the versions of the app's code but fortunately enough, each device only download it's copy of the code.<br>
&nbsp;*Android:* Distributed as CPU-indpendent "bytecode" that's converted to device's native code at runtime. More portable, but adds overhead.
