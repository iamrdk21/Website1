**Rickrolling:** *Rickrolling, alternatively rick-rolling, is a prank and an Internet meme involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song "Never Gonna Give You Up". The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the music video.*

For people who've been around on the internet for a while might recognize "*rick-rolling*" as one of the greatest web-pranks. But nobody, in their wildest dreams, thought that we might see the day when the prank was pulled off on **Rick Astley**, the man himself. This has been an epic moment for Redditors with thousands of fans taking delight and commenting that they just witnessed a really important moment in the Reddit history.

**Rick Astley** posted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/haucpf/ive_found_a_few_funny_memories_during_lockdown/">photograph</a> of himself from his first tour as a professional musician (1989) to the subreddit **r/pics**.

Reacting to this post, the comments were flodded with fans praising the pop star's *Wayback Wednesday* photo. But the best reaction was given by **u/theMalleableDuck**. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/haucpf/ive_found_a_few_funny_memories_during_lockdown/fv505w1/">"*I think I might cry!!! It's actually you. I met you at a backstage event when I was 12,*"</a> the message read, including a hyperlink to what would presumably be a photo of a young fan posing with Rick.

The link led, of course, to the video of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Never Gonna Give You Up</a>" and the singer reacted to the Redditor's witty comment with a clapping emoji. Well played.

2020 has given us nothin but a non-stop stream of bad news. An amusing and humorous moment like this could not have come at a better time. And as for **Rick Astley**, I don't think he's going to be clicking any more Reddit links anytime soon.
