***The Da Vinci Code:*** *The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery thriller novel by Dan Brown. It is Brown's second novel to include the character Robert Langdon: the first was his 2000 novel Angels & Demons.*

While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci, clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.

Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion, a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo and Da Vinci, and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle, while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move, the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.

The Da Vinci Code heralds the arrival of a new breed of lightning-paced, intelligent thriller…surprising at every twist, absorbing at every turn, and in the end, utterly unpredictable…right up to its astonishing conclusion.

First of all, the people who have seen the movie and not read the book: a big loss for you guys! After reading this book, people either passionately love it or hate it. And I belong to the former category. I am utterly amazed by this masterpiece, and the author's ability to keep the readers on the edge from page one up until the end is simply commendable. It's admirable how Brown took real events, real symbols and wove them into such a detailed story about a secret that could change everyone's beliefs, change the entire world as we know it. This book is full of cryptic messages and honestly it is astounding how our protagonists decipher the codes ultimately leading to the truth. The structure was almost similar to <a href="https://www.inchoate.me/2020-06-03-angels-and-demons-book-review/">Angels & Demons</a>, although now we didn't have the *lluminati*, instead it was a single person, ready to take down an entire city.

This book deals with issues that are sensitive, like religious institutions and gender equality, and thus contoversies were bound to happen. Well, if you ask me, Brown's accusation of the Church for suppessing feminine divinity figures is justified and needs a closer look. Our religious systems and institutions lack balance and have a bias to suppress issues, stories, and roles that empower women to live as equals to men. His stories are written simplistically to reach and engage a larger audience. Though the narrative is not fresh, the message it conveys is loud and clear. Dan Brown tells a story that needs to be told. A story that has been kept quiet and in the dark for a long time.

***Favourite quote from the book:*** *Men go to far greater lengths to avoid what they fear than to obtain what they desire.*

As Dan Brown books are popularly quoted: ***Thriller writing doesn’t get any better than this.***
