Being an **iPhone SE (2016)** user, I have always been a fan of **Apple**. I did not upgrade from my iPhone SE because nothing Apple has put out since has interested me. iPhone SE is a powerful little beast. My SE is running the latest iOS 13.5.1 with absolutely no issues (it's been 4 years!). I still use wired headphones. The size of my phone is perfect and I have no desire for a larger screen. I can reach the whole screen comfortably with one hand and it fits very well in the pockets. No camera bump either! I also don't want a huge phone strapped to my forearm while running. The overall build and design has been the best they've ever put.

The design of the **iPhone SE** which resembles the **iPhone 5** and **iPhone 5S** had been the selling point for me. I don't know why but I really love the design. 

Apple was going to launch the successor of **iPhone SE** in 2019, which obviously got me very excited. There had been rounds of the bezel-less **iPhone SE** concept: the overhauling of the **iPhone SE** with the **iPhone X**.

Just look at this concept smartphone. What a beauty! What an absolute beauty!

But, due to some technicalities, Apple was unable to launch this phone in 2019. 

In January 2020, the first leak-based renders and a 360-degree video of the **iPhone SE 2** surfaced online, the same time frame in which the phone was expected to enter mass production. To everybody's surprise, the renders revealed an **iPhone-8** like design, single rear camera, thick bezels and the Touch ID button.

This leak got mixed reviews and I just hoped this leak would not be true as I detested the design. But alas - it is 2020!

24 April 2020 - the new "**iPhone SE 2020 launched**" with the same specifications as in the leaks.

Although the design is something I disapprove of, in the new **iPhone SE 2020**, there are some other genuine reasons as well, which one should consider before buying it. 

Here are the reasons why I think you should not buy the **iPhone SE 2020**:

- ***Value For Money:***<br>
**iPhone SE 2020** has got a lot of appreciation outside India. And well, isn't it obvious? You're getting all the specifications of **iPhone 11** ($699) at almost half the price ($399). But, that my friend is not the case in India. This phone has been launched at a whopping Rs. 42,500 which clearly is not value for money. It is better to buy **iPhone XR** or another Android Device in this price range, or wait for sale and then buy **iPhone 11**.

- ***Design:***<br>
Apple's decision to reuse the design to **iPhone 8** - which dates back to the six year old **iPhone 6** - is a stretch. The bezels surrounding the **iPhone SE** display are quite large. It makes the design look a bit dated. Screens have become much more advanced with slimmer bezels that maximize the use of screen display. State-of-the-art phones have made a big leap in the bezel-less technology, so why would anyone want to buy a recycled **iPhone 8**?

- ***Unnecessary Specs:***<br>
**iPhone SE 2020** comes with the industry leading A13 Bionic chipset. The major use of this chipset was for functionalities like triple-cameras, depth-sensing AR and Face ID. None of which is available in the new **iPhone SE**. A13 Bionic is years ahead of any other chip - just the body in which it is crammed is obsolete. People who buy the **iPhone SE** will hardly be able to make complete use of the A13 Bionic. And those who want to use the chipset to the fullest will shift to something that comes with the colour-accuracy of OLED displays, variety of camera options and maybe a bigger screen rather than buying **iPhone SE 2020**.

- ***No Night Mode:***<br>
Night Mode is a feature designed to capture clear, crisp photos even when lighting conditions are poor, such as at night. But in this case, when the lights go way down you'll probably want to use the flash on your **iPhone SE**. Apple should have offered "Night Mode" in the new **iPhone SE** but this feature is reserved for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro Series.
