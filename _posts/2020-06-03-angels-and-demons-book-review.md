***Angels & Demons:*** *A 2000 bestselling mystery-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and published by Pocket Books and then by Corgi Books. The novel introduces the character Robert Langdon, who recurs as the protagonist of Brown's subsequent novels.*

Dan Brown is regarded as one of the best mystery-thriller writer of all times. I'm a big Dan Brown fan and have read all of his books.

"**Angels and Demons**" was my first Dan Brown novel. I never knew what symbology was until I read this book. The protagonist **Robert Langdon** is a Harvard University professor of history of art and symbology. This is the best novel I've ever read and the story gets you totally hooked with every turning page.

A priest (also a scientist at CERN) is murdered..the word **ILLUMINATI** is branded on his chest..anti-matter has been stolen..Rome is the epicenter..the task of finding the antimatter and the murderer has been assigned to the renowned symbologist Robert Langdon. But can he curb the use of this antimatter as a weapon of mass-destruction along with the CERN physicist Vittoria Vetra?

Angels & Demons is Dan Brown at his best. I had never found history so interesting. The way in which he takes all the historical places, events, art and turns them upside down into a power-packed thriller leaves the reader wanting more of it. In this novel, he brings up the old debate of Science vs Religion. He has beautifully placed the arguments of both the sides and in the end it is up to the reader to decide which side is the right path for them. 

Another thing I liked about this book was the time crunch. The entire story unfolds in 12 hrs. The writer has taken full advantage of this. We as readers also feel this pressure of time which in return results in the adrenaline rush. In my opinion, the pace with which this book has been written can make anybody finish this book under 6 days.

***Favourite quote from the book:*** *Nothing captures human interest more than human tragedy.*

I had read novels before but was never an avid reader. To be honest, it was Dan Brown who got me more involved in reading. You rarely find such enjoyable, action-packed thrillers and this is why his books are so popular!
