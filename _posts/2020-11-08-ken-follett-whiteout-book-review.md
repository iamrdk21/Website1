***Whiteout:*** *Whiteout is a thriller novel written by British author Ken Follett about the theft of a deadly virus from a lab in snow-covered Scotland.*

A lab technician bleeding from the eyes. Twelve missing samples of a deadly virus. Toni Gallo, the security director of a Scottish medical research firm, knows she has problems, but she has no idea of the nightmare to come.

As a Christmas Eve blizzard whips out of the north, several people, Toni among them, converge on a remote family house. All have something to gain or lose from the drug developed to fight the virus. As the storm worsens, the emotional sparks - jealousies, distrust, sexual attraction, rivalries - crackle; desperate secrets are revealed; hidden traitors and unexpected heroes emerge. FIlled with startling twists at every turn, Whiteout rockets Follett into a class by himself.

Christmas Eve should be a time of joy and family, but for one medical research firm’s CEO, it becomes a night of terror, blood and death. Biological terrorism is horrific, but when one deadly virus is stolen, Christmas Eve will become anything but silent and holy.

Ken Follett’s WHITEOUT pits greed, dark secrets and deadly plots against the clock as Mother Nature does her part to foul up any chance of success for one man, forced to steal from his father’s company to pay his gambling debts. What he hadn’t planned on was that if anything could go wrong, it would.

Part biological thriller, part soap opera, this thriller is filled with chilling grit as one family’s drama plays out and unlikely heroes step up.

I was completely captivated with the theft of a potential biological weapon, but found the family soap opera portion to be a bit distracting as dirty little secrets are revealed and the perfect family’s façade is cracked. Lots of drama, lots of bad blood and some clichéd bad guys whip this thriller into a froth of bloody terror.
